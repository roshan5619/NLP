# üó£Ô∏è Collocations in Natural Language Processing

This project explores how to identify **collocations** ‚Äî pairs or groups of words that frequently occur together ‚Äî using natural language processing techniques. Collocations like ‚Äústrong tea‚Äù or ‚Äúmake a decision‚Äù carry meaning that isn‚Äôt obvious from individual words. This notebook introduces statistical and linguistic methods to extract and analyze such patterns from text.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Collocations are essential for understanding the structure and semantics of language. This notebook walks through:

- What collocations are and why they matter
- Loading and tokenizing text corpora
- Measuring collocation strength using:
  - Frequency
  - Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
  - t-test and chi-square
- Extracting bigrams and trigrams
- Visualizing common collocations

The project is educational, compact, and ideal for those learning NLP fundamentals.
