# üß¨ Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for NLP

This project explores the application of **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. VAEs are powerful generative models that learn meaningful latent representations and can generate novel text samples. This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of training a VAE on text data using PyTorch.

## üöÄ Overview

Variational Autoencoders combine probabilistic inference with neural networks, allowing us to:
- Encode text into a continuous latent space
- Reconstruct input sentences
- Generate new, coherent sentences by sampling from the latent space

This notebook is ideal for:
- Learning the architecture and loss functions of VAEs
- Applying deep generative models to textual data
- Experimenting with sequence modeling in PyTorch
